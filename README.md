## Overview

This project implements the Frisch-Hasslacher-Pomeau (FHP) lattice gas automaton model that Feynman helped develop during his time working on the Connection Machine. It demonstrates his key insight: **complex fluid behavior emerges from particles following simple rules**.

The simulation shows how "perfect ball bearings" moving at constant speed in only 6 directions on a hexagonal lattice can produce realistic fluid dynamics - including vortex shedding, turbulence, and flow around obstacles.

## Background

This implementation is based on the fascinating memoir ["Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine"](https://longnow.org/ideas/richard-feynman-and-the-connection-machine/) by Danny Hillis, co-founder of Thinking Machines Corporation. The article describes Feynman's contributions to parallel computing and his elegant explanations of cellular automata for physical simulation.

As Feynman explained:
> "We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings."

## Features

### Core Simulation
- **Hexagonal Lattice Gas Automaton**: Implements the FHP model with 6-directional particle movement
- **Momentum-Conserving Collisions**: Particles scatter according to simple rules that conserve momentum
- **Emergent Fluid Dynamics**: Navier-Stokes-like behavior emerges from simple particle interactions
- **Real-time Visualization**: Multiple rendering modes to observe different aspects of the flow

### Interactive Controls
- **Adjustable Parameters**:
  - Particle density (0.1 - 0.9)
  - Flow speed (0.0 - 0.3)
  - Target FPS (10 - 60)
  - Simulation speed (0.1x - 5x)

- **Visualization Modes**:
  - Individual particles
  - Density field
  - Velocity field
  - Vorticity field

- **Obstacle Interaction**:
  - Click to add cylindrical obstacles
  - Observe von Kármán vortex streets
  - Clear obstacles to reset flow

## Technical Details

### The FHP Model

The simulation uses the Frisch-Hasslacher-Pomeau hexagonal lattice gas automaton:

1. **Lattice Structure**: Hexagonal grid where each site has 6 possible particle states
2. **Particle Movement**: Particles move at unit speed in one of 6 directions (60° apart)
3. **Collision Rules**:
   - Head-on collisions (180°): Particles scatter to ±60°
   - Triple collisions (120° apart): Rotate by 60°
   - All collisions conserve particle number and momentum
4. **Boundary Conditions**: Bounce-back at obstacles, periodic at edges

### Implementation

- **Pure JavaScript**: No dependencies or frameworks required
- **Canvas API**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Optimized Updates**: Efficient lattice updates using typed arrays
- **Parallel-Ready**: Structure mimics Connection Machine's parallel architecture

## Physics Demonstrated

- **Viscous Flow**: Emergence of viscosity from particle collisions
- **Vortex Shedding**: von Kármán vortex streets behind obstacles
- **Flow Separation**: Realistic boundary layer behavior
- **Turbulence**: Chaotic flow at higher Reynolds numbers
- **Conservation Laws**: Mass and momentum conservation

## Educational Value
