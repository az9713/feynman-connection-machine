- Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- A clear description of the enhancement
- Explanation of why this would be useful
- Possible implementation approach
- Examples or mockups if applicable

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Keep it Simple**: Follow Feynman's philosophy - if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex algorithms, but code should be self-documenting where possible
- **Performance**: This is a real-time simulation - performance matters
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure code works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Areas for Contribution

#### Physics Enhancements
- Additional collision rules
- Different lattice geometries (triangular, square)
- 3D lattice gas implementation
- Multi-speed particle models

#### Visualization Improvements
- Streamline visualization
- Pressure field display
- Temperature/energy visualization
- Particle trajectory tracking

#### Performance Optimizations
- WebGL rendering
- Web Workers for computation
- WebAssembly implementation
- GPU acceleration via WebGPU

#### Educational Features
- Interactive tutorials
- Preset scenarios (pipe flow, airfoil, etc.)
- Parameter exploration tools
- Comparison with Navier-Stokes solutions

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- Mobile responsive design
- Touch controls for tablets
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Save/load simulation states

### Testing

Please test your changes across different browsers and include information about testing in your PR:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (if available)
- Edge (latest)

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Include JSDoc comments for new functions
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms
- Update this CONTRIBUTING.md if process changes

## Philosophy

This project embodies Feynman's approach to science and education:

1. **Clarity over Complexity**: Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler
2. **Understanding through Teaching**: Document and explain so others can learn
3. **Playful Exploration**: Encourage experimentation and discovery
4. **Fundamental Principles**: Focus on core physics, not just pretty visualizations

## Recognition

Contributors will be acknowledged in the project README. Significant contributions may warrant co-authorship in any resulting publications or presentations.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for questions about contributing. Remember Feynman's words: "I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned."

## Note on AI-Generated Code

This project was initially generated by Claude Code (Anthropic's Claude). We welcome both human and AI-assisted contributions, but please:
- Disclose if contributions are AI-generated or AI-assisted
- Ensure you understand and can explain any code you submit
- Test thoroughly - AI can make mistakes too!
